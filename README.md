MediPredict: Intelligent EHR Management and Disease Prediction System
– Developed a secure, AI-powered web-based platform to manage Electronic Health Records (EHR) and predict critical diseases like heart stroke and lung conditions.
– Integrated supervised machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) for heart stroke prediction and deep learning CNN architectures (ResNet, VGG16) for lung disease detection from medical imaging.
– Ensured data standardization, encryption, and role-based access control to enhance healthcare data security and interoperability.
– Enabled early diagnosis and clinical decision support by combining structured/unstructured EHR data with predictive analytics.
